# Planet Generator
I started this project to build on other procedural noise and terrain generation I have done in the past.  

I hope to combine this work with a QT interface to produce a fairly simple "Planet Generator", by which I mean roughly spherical object that's sruface is displaced and textured procedurally.

This project is created in Visual Studio 2015 Community edition,  using QT 5.5.1 (open source) and the QT5Package extension for VS2015.
